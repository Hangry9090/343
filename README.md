# 343-HW1
Git Repository for 343


The most used commands that I will use seem to be:

*With the prefix of 'git'*
- init - Creates the repository 

- pull - Takes the repository from the server held version and copies that version to the work space
- push - Copies the workspace version of the repository and sends it to the git server

- add - Places files in the "staging area"
- commit - Makes changes to the local repository
- status - Gives the current status of files in the staging area

- branch - Creates a copy of the local repository that can be edited without changing the master
- checkout - How one moves between branches
- merge - Merges a branch back into another

I may occationally use git log but it seems like that would be better to see in the chrome version.
